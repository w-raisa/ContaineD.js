			<h1>How to incorporate ContaineD.js into your code:</h1>
			<h3>1. Link the ContaineD.js file to your HTML</h3>
			<div>
				<div class="code-container"> 
					<p class="code"><pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/ContaineD.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h3>2. Import the CSS file</h3>
			<div>
				<div class="code-container"> 
					<p class="code"><pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/containeD.css"&gt;</pre></p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h3>3. Import ContaineD.js dependencies (just jQuery)</h3>
			<div>
				<div class="code-container"> 
					<p class="code"><pre>&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h3>4. Write HTML markup to get ContaineD.js elements onto your page</h3>
			<div>
				<div class="code-container" id="code-container-1"> 
					<p class="manip">If you would like to use the Translating Deck of Cards (as seen on the Examples page), incorporate the following into your HTML:</p>
					<div class="HTML-examples">
						<pre>
&lt;div class="containeD-containeR"&gt;
    &lt;div class="containeD-trigger"&gt; 
      &lt;div class="containeD-box1"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			<h3>As seen in step 6, you can manipulate various DOM elements using ContaineD.js, and there are methods as part of the library that will help you do this.</h3>

						<li class="method-container">
							<div class="method-description">
								<pre>translatingCards(triggerBox, cardBox, speed, timeFunction, translateX, translateY, endX, endY, rotationDeg)</pre>
								<p>Perform a translation of cardBox as specified by the arguments. This function will cause all DOM elements that have the same HTML class 	as cardBox to be translated, hence the name translatingCards. If you would like to translate exactly one card and none other, see translateCard.</p>
								<p>Arguments:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>

									<li>
										speed: int, specifies how fast the translation is in milliseconds. Valid input is any int greater than or equal to 0.
									</li>
									<li>
										timeFunction: str, specifies the rate the translation will take place at. timeFunction can be any one value of “ease”, “linear”, “ease-in”, “ease-out”, “ease-in-out”,  or “cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n)”. If you would like to know what values of n to give to the cubic-bezier function, should you choose that, <a href="https://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67">this website</a> lets you play around with the function with different values for n.
									</li>
									<li>
										translateX: int, specifies how many units in X on a standard 2D Cartesian-Plane cardBox will be translated. Can take in any real number.
									</li>

						<li class="method-container">
							<div class="method-description">
								<pre>backgroundColourTransition(box, startingColour, endingColour, speed)</pre>
								<p>Apply a colour transition on box from startingColour to endingColor.</p>
								<p>Arguments:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										box: DOM element, the DOM container you wish to apply a background colour transition on.
									</li>
									<li>
										startingColour: str, specifies the colour the transition will begin with. Accepts names of colours ie startingColour=“black” is valid, as well as hexadecimal values of colours ie startingColor=“#000000” is valid.
									</li>
									<li> 
										endingColour: str, specifies the colour the transition will end with. Accepts names of colours ie endingColour=“black” is valid, as well as hexadecimal values of colours ie endingColor=“#000000” is valid.
									</li>
									<li>

								<p>Applies an animation sequence to card</p>
								<p>Arguments:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										card: DOM element, the container you wish to apply an animation on.
									</li>
									<li>
										timeFunction: str, specifies the rate the translation will take place at. timeFunction can be any one value of “ease”, “linear”, “ease-in”, “ease-out”, “ease-in-out”,  or “cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n)”. If you would like to know what values of n to give to the cubic-bezier function, should you choose that, please take a look at <a href="https://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67">this website</a>; it lets you play around with the function with different values for n.
									</li>
									<li> 
										iterationCount: str/int, specifies the number of times this animation will play. If you would like the animation to play x number of times and then stop, set iterationCount = x (an int value greater than or equal to 0). If you would like animation to repeat indefinitely and never stop, set iterationCount=“infinite” (str).

									</li>
									<li>
										speed: int, specifies how fast the animation is in seconds. Valid input is any int greater than or equal to 0.
									</li>
									<li>
										animationDirection: str, specifies whether the order this animation will follow. Accepted values are “normal”, “reverse”, “alternate”, and “alternate-reverse”.
									</li>
									<li>
										animationSeq: JSON, specifies the individual steps the animation will exhibit from start to end. The keys of the JSON object specify the step of the animation, and the values specify what will take place at this step of the animation. The keys of the JSON object must be ints, ranging between 0 and 100 inclusive. The values are another JSON object, whose keys represent the name of a CSS property, and the values represent the value that CSS property will have. An example value passed in for animationSeq would be:
										<pre>		
var animationSeq = {
	"0": { 
		"background": "pink",
		"opacity": "1",
		},
	“42”: {
		"opacity": “0.5”,
		},
	"100": {
		"background": "yellow",
		"opacity": "0",
		},
	}
										</pre>
										This is a valid value for animationSeq, it basically says “At step 0 of the animation (beginning of the animation), set the background colour of card (the DOM element passing into this function) to pink, and set its opacity to 1. At step 42 of the animation (42% of the animation has been played at this point), set the opacity of card to 0.5. At step 100 of the animation (100% of the animation has been played at this point, so we are at the end of the animation), set the background colour of card to yellow, and its opacity to 0”. This JSON object is something you as the developer create, you get to choose which CSS properties you want to change, what you want to change it to, and at what step. ContaineD.js handles the actual animation for you ;)
									</li>
									<li>
										animationPlayState: str, specifies the state this animation will start off with, and the state it will be in when a mouse hovers over card. The state the animation will be in when mouse hovers over card will be opposite of animationPlayState. Accepts “running” and “paused”, which are opposites of each other. 
										<ul>
											<li>
												If animationPlayState=“running”, then the animation will begin right away, but upon the event a mouse hovers over card, the animation will pause. When the mouse leaves card, the animation will no longer be paused and will continue running. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Similarly if animationPlayState=“paused”, the animation will not play unless a mouse hovers over card. animationPlayState is also an optional argument, if it is not provided, then the animation will run regardless of whether a mouse hovers over card or not.
